/**
 * Assume the following rules are for the tic-tac-toe game on an n x n board between two players:
 *
 * A move is guaranteed to be valid and is placed on an empty block.
 * Once a winning condition is reached, no more moves are allowed.
 * A player who succeeds in placing n of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.
 * Implement the TicTacToe class:
 *
 * TicTacToe(int n) Initializes the object the size of the board n.
 * int move(int row, int col, int player) Indicates that the player with id player plays at the cell (row, col) of the board. The move is guaranteed to be a valid move, and the two players alternate in making moves. Return
 * 0 if there is no winner after the move,
 * 1 if player 1 is the winner after the move, or
 * 2 if player 2 is the winner after the move.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input
 * ["TicTacToe", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move", "move"]
 * [[3], [0, 0, 1], [0, 2, 2], [2, 2, 1], [1, 1, 2], [2, 0, 1], [1, 0, 2], [2, 1, 1]]
 * Output
 * [null, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]
 *
 * Explanation
 * TicTacToe ticTacToe = new TicTacToe(3);
 * Assume that player 1 is "X" and player 2 is "O" in the board.
 * ticTacToe.move(0, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
 * |X| | |
 * | | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (0, 0).
 * | | | |
 *
 * ticTacToe.move(0, 2, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
 * |X| |O|
 * | | | |    // Player 2 makes a move at (0, 2).
 * | | | |
 *
 * ticTacToe.move(2, 2, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
 * |X| |O|
 * | | | |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 2).
 * | | |X|
 *
 * ticTacToe.move(1, 1, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
 * |X| |O|
 * | |O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 1).
 * | | |X|
 *
 * ticTacToe.move(2, 0, 1); // return 0 (no one wins)
 * |X| |O|
 * | |O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 0).
 * |X| |X|
 *
 * ticTacToe.move(1, 0, 2); // return 0 (no one wins)
 * |X| |O|
 * |O|O| |    // Player 2 makes a move at (1, 0).
 * |X| |X|
 *
 * ticTacToe.move(2, 1, 1); // return 1 (player 1 wins)
 * |X| |O|
 * |O|O| |    // Player 1 makes a move at (2, 1).
 * |X|X|X|
