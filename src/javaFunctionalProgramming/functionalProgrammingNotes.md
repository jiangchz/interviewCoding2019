###What is functional programming
Functional programming is sometimes considered to be a set of techniques that supplement or replace techniques found in other programming paradigms

Functional programming <-> imperative programming

- imperative programming 
programs are composed from elements that "do" something (state mutation)
- functional programming 
programs are composed of elements that "are" something - they don't "do" something

When you encounter 2 + 3, then you replace with 5

#### functional programming has no side effects (observable)
- No mutation of variables
- No printing to the console or to any device 
- No writing to files, databases, networks, or whatever
- No exception throwing

### benefits of functional programming
1. Functional programs are easier to reason about because they're deterministic
2. Functional programs are easier to test because there are no side effect and don't need to mock
3. Functional programs are more modular because they're build from function that only have input and output
4. Functional programming makes composition and recombination much easier.
